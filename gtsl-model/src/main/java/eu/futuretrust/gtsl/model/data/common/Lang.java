/**
 * Specified in TS 119 612 v2.1.1 clause 5.1.4 Language support
 *
 * A multilingual character string shall be a character string as defined in ISO/IEC 10646 encoded
 * in UTF-8. Each multilingual pointer shall consist of two parts: a tag, conformant to IETF RFC
 * 5646, that identifies the language in which the content pointed-to by the URI is expressed, and
 * the URI expressed as a character string with the syntax specified by IETF RFC 3986 , identifying
 * a resource expressed in the given language. The same content may be represented in multiple
 * languages by a sequence of multilingual pointers. Whenever the native terms cannot be represented
 * using the Latin alphabet, as defined in ISO/IEC 10646, one issue of the term in the native
 * language plus one issue with a transliteration to the Latin alphabet shall be used. Implementers
 * should also comply with the UNICODE Standard (available at http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).
 * Further detailed requirements regarding multilingual
 *
 * @see <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63182.html">ISO/IEC 10646:2014</a>
 * @see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">IETF RFC 5646</a>
